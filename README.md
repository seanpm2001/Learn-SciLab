### Learning SciLab

I am not too experienced with the SciLab programming language at the moment. This document will go over my knowledge of the SciLab language so far.

This document uses version 6.1 of the SciLab programming language.

#### Comments in SciLab

Comments in SciLab are similar to most common programming languages (such as Java, JavaScript, Google Go, etc.) they are written like this

```scilab
// This is a single line comment in SciLab
// SciLab doesn't support multi-line comments as far as I know.
```

This example works with every version of SciLab, except for some versions of OpenSciLab.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Break keyword in SciLab

SciLab supports the `break` keyword:

```scilab
break
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Hello World in SciLab

A hello world program in SciLab is similar to some uncommon languages that I can't currently recall. It is written like so:

```scilab
// Hello World in SciLab
disp("Hello World");
```

This example works with every version of SciLab (as far as I know)

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Source

The majority of my SciLab knowledge comes from reading documentationn on Wikipedia. I know very little about the language at the moment.

#### Other knowledge of SciLab

1. SciLab is a numeric programming language

2. SciLab uses the `*.sci` file extension

3. SciLab is one of the 3 alternatives to MATLAB

4. SciLab wasn't designed to be syntax similar to MATLAB, but its users note the ease of converting MATLAB to SciLab

5. SciLab as a language dates back to the year 1990

6. SciLab is a language recognized by GitHub

7. SciLab is an open source language

8. No other knowledge of SciLab at the moment.
